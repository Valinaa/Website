# Website

[中文文档](README.zh_CN.md)

* A personal website with multiple modules, currently including ***Home*** (Welcome page), ***Main*** (Home page), ***Blog*** (Blog page), ***Intro*** (Author introduction page).
* The website development is continuously updating, and it is expected that there will be 1-2 more modules. If you are interested, please continue to follow or contact the author for technical exchange.
* The Website development adopts the latest technology stack, such as TypeScript (5.0+), Vue3 Setup, Vite (4.0+), WindiCSS (to be replaced with UnoCSS in the future), etc.

## *Note！*

* Due to the limitations of the author's personal abilities and demands, this multi module repo does not adopt `Multi-Page Application(MPA)` of `Vue`, but is divided into individual `Single-Page Application(SPA)` that can be selected according to personal needs.
* If you need it, you can also configure multi page components yourself. If you have successfully built a MPA website, your feedback is also very welcome, providing another choice for other open-source enthusiasts!

## Author Speak

* I'm not familiar with front-end development, and website development is purely a matter of interest, so please forgive me for many aspects that are not rigorous or complete.
* If you have any questions, suggestions, or other ideas, then can communicate with me (or raise an Issue)
* You can fork this repository or what you need on your own development, and I'll appreciate it if you could feedback with personalized development!
